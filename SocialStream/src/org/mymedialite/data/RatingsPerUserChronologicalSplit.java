 * Per-user chronological split for rating prediction.

 * a certain time as training ratings, and the ones after that time as test/validation ratings.

 * Here, the split date may differ from user to user.
 * In the constructor, you can either specify which part (ratio) or how many of a user's rating
 * are supposed to be used for validation.
 *
 * The dataset must not be modified after the split - this would lead to undefined behavior.
